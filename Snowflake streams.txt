1.Can stream create on permenent tables or we can create it on temprory table as well?
	=> Supported Table Types for Streams : Permanent Tables,Transient Tables,External Tables,Views
	=> stream cannot create on temporary tables.

2. Can stream stores physical data?
	=> Snowflake stream does not store physical data. Instead, it maintains a lightweight offset
	
3. can we create multiple streams on single table?
	=> Yes, you can create multiple streams on a single table in Snowflake.
    =>	Each stream operates independently, maintaining its own offset

4. If 2 person created 2 different stream on same table they will have same data in stream if my source table changes. 
   then what is use of creating multiple streams on same table?
   => Standard Streams :Tracks: Inserts, updates, and deletes.
   =>  Append-Only Streams : Tracks: Only insert operations.
   => Insert-Only Streams: Tracks: Only insert operations on external tables.
   
5. What if i dont consume stream will my data lost?
 => Yes. 
 => Each table has a data retention period, typically up to 90 days,
	during which changes can be queried. If a stream is not consumed within this retention period,
	it can become stale, meaning its offset moves outside the available data retention window,
	and the changes it was tracking are no longer accessible.
		
6. How to increemntally load data using stream?
	=> using merage statement
	
			MERGE INTO target_table AS target
		USING source_stream AS source
		ON target.id = source.id
		WHEN MATCHED AND source.METADATA$ACTION = 'DELETE' THEN
		  DELETE
		WHEN MATCHED AND source.METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT' THEN
		  INSERT (id, name, updated_at)
		  VALUES (source.id, source.name, source.updated_at)
		WHEN NOT MATCHED AND source.METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT' THEN
		  INSERT (id, name, updated_at)
		  VALUES (source.id, source.name, source.updated_at);

7. How do I know which is latest record if single record updated 10 times before consuming stream?
	=> METADATA$ACTION	 METADATA$ISUPDATE
         INSERT	          TRUE
	=> In this scenario, the stream captures only the final update as an insert operation. 
	   The METADATA$ISUPDATE column indicates that this change was part of an update
	   
8. When stream became steal?
	=> A Snowflake stream becomes stale when its offset—the point up to 
	  which changes have been tracked—falls outside the data retention period of its source table or view.
	  STALE_AFTER = FALSE --means stream is steal
