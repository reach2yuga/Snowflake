Mark the correct statements with respect to secure views and their creation in the Snowflake
Account.
A. For a secure view, internal optimizations can indirectly expose data and the view definition
is visible to other users.
B. Secure views should not be used for views that are defined solely for query convenience,
such as views created to simplify queries for users who do not need to understand the
underlying data representation.
C. To convert an existing view to a secure view and back to a regular view, set/unset the
SECURE keyword in the ALTER VIEW or ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW command.
D. For non-materialized views, the IS_SECURE column in the Information Schema and Account
Usage views identifies whether a view is secure.
E. The internals of a secure view are not exposed in the Query Profile (in the web interface).
This is the case even for the owner of the secure view because non-owners might have access
to an owner's Query Profile.
