virtual warehouse:
A virtual warehouse, often referred to simply as a “warehouse”, is a cluster of compute resources in Snowflake.
A virtual warehouse is available in two types:
  1. Standard
  2. Snowpark-optimized
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A warehouse provides:
  1. resources, such as CPU
  2. memory,
  3.and temporary storage, to perform the DML,Select,Loading ,unloading operations

Note :
To perform these operations, a warehouse must be running and in use for the session. While a warehouse is running, it consumes Snowflake credits.

Warehouse considerations : best practices for using virtual warehouses in Snowflake to process queries.
A warehouse is affected by numerous factors =>
  1. number of concurrent users/queries
  2. number of tables being queried, 
  3. data size and composition,
  4. pecific requirements for warehouse availability, latency, and cost.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How are credits charged for warehouses?
Credit charges are calculated based on:
  1. The warehouse size.
  2. The number of clusters (if using multi-cluster warehouses).
  3. The length of time the compute resources in each cluster runs.
