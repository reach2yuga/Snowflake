virtual warehouse:
A virtual warehouse, often referred to simply as a “warehouse”, is a cluster of compute resources in Snowflake.
A virtual warehouse is available in two types:
  1. Standard
  2. Snowpark-optimized
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A warehouse provides:
  1. resources, such as CPU
  2. memory,
  3.and temporary storage, to perform the DML,Select,Loading ,unloading operations

Note :
To perform these operations, a warehouse must be running and in use for the session. While a warehouse is running, it consumes Snowflake credits.

Warehouse considerations : best practices for using virtual warehouses in Snowflake to process queries.
A warehouse is affected by numerous factors =>
  1. number of concurrent users/queries
  2. number of tables being queried, 
  3. data size and composition,
  4. pecific requirements for warehouse availability, latency, and cost.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How are credits charged for warehouses?
Credit charges are calculated based on:
  1. The warehouse size.
  2. The number of clusters (if using multi-cluster warehouses).
  3. The length of time the compute resources in each cluster runs.

🔹 Key Rule:
  1. Minimum billing time per session is 60 seconds.
  2. After the first 60 seconds, billing is per-second.
  3. If the warehouse shuts down, any new start incurs another minimum 60-second charge.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example of understanding how snowflake virtual warehouse billing works:

1. Warehouse runs for 30 to 60 seconds → Billed for 60 seconds
Since it's less than 60 seconds, it hits the minimum billing duration.
✅ Charged time = 60 seconds

2. Warehouse runs for 61 seconds → Billed for 61 seconds
First 60 seconds → Minimum charge
The 1 extra second → Charged per-second
✅ Charged time = 61 seconds

3. Warehouse runs for 61 seconds, shuts down, restarts and runs < 60 seconds → Billed for 121 seconds
First run:
60 seconds minimum + 1 second = 61 seconds
Second run (after restart):
Less than 60 seconds → Minimum 60 seconds charge applies again
✅ Charged time = 61 + 60 = 121 seconds
