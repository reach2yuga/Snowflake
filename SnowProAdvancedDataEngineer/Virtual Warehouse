virtual warehouse:
A virtual warehouse, often referred to simply as a “warehouse”, is a cluster of compute resources in Snowflake.
A virtual warehouse is available in two types:
  1. Standard
  2. Snowpark-optimized
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A warehouse provides:
  1. resources, such as CPU
  2. memory,
  3.and temporary storage, to perform the DML,Select,Loading ,unloading operations

Note :
To perform these operations, a warehouse must be running and in use for the session. While a warehouse is running, it consumes Snowflake credits.

Warehouse considerations : best practices for using virtual warehouses in Snowflake to process queries.
A warehouse is affected by numerous factors =>
  1. number of concurrent users/queries
  2. number of tables being queried, 
  3. data size and composition,
  4. pecific requirements for warehouse availability, latency, and cost.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How are credits charged for warehouses?
Credit charges are calculated based on:
  1. The warehouse size.
  2. The number of clusters (if using multi-cluster warehouses).
  3. The length of time the compute resources in each cluster runs.

🔹 Key Rule:
  1. Minimum billing time per session is 60 seconds.
  2. After the first 60 seconds, billing is per-second.
  3. If the warehouse shuts down, any new start incurs another minimum 60-second charge.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example of understanding how snowflake virtual warehouse billing works:

1. Warehouse runs for 30 to 60 seconds → Billed for 60 seconds
Since it's less than 60 seconds, it hits the minimum billing duration.
✅ Charged time = 60 seconds

2. Warehouse runs for 61 seconds → Billed for 61 seconds
First 60 seconds → Minimum charge
The 1 extra second → Charged per-second
✅ Charged time = 61 seconds

3. Warehouse runs for 61 seconds, shuts down, restarts and runs < 60 seconds → Billed for 121 seconds
First run:
60 seconds minimum + 1 second = 61 seconds
Second run (after restart):
Less than 60 seconds → Minimum 60 seconds charge applies again
✅ Charged time = 61 + 60 = 121 seconds

  🔑 Key Points:

  1. Query Complexity Affects Compute Usage =>
      More complex queries require more compute resources.
      Larger warehouses generally handle complex queries more efficiently.

  2. Warehouse Size Scales Linearly=>
      As warehouse size increases, performance improves — especially for complex or large queries.
      
  3. Data Size Matters More Than Row Count
      The total size of the tables (in GB or TB) has a greater impact than just the number of rows.

  4. Query Structure Influences Performance
      Use of filters (predicates), joins, and number of tables directly affect query load.

  5. Consistency Helps Optimization
      Run similar types of queries (in terms of complexity and data sets) on the same warehouse.
      Mixing simple and complex queries in one warehouse can make performance tuning harder.
