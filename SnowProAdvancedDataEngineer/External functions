2. Mark all the correct recommendations to improve latency of External functions?
A) Place the API Gateway in a different cloud platform and region compared to the one
having your Snowflake instance
B) If you wrote the remote service (rather than using an existing service), deploy that
remote service in the same cloud platform and region as it is called from.
C) Filter data using Snowflake SQL and then send only filtered records to reduce latency
of response
