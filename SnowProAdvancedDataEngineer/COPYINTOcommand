 David, a Data Engineer, has been asked to create a backup strategy for critical tables in
Snowflake. Which of the following actions should he include in his strategy?
A. Use the COPY INTO command to export data to external storage regularly.
B. Implement fail-safe mechanisms for all critical tables.
C. Schedule regular snapshots of the tables using the CLONE command.
D. Enable multi-cluster warehouses for high availability.
Answer : A
Explanation - B is out because fail safe is available by default and no setting change is required to
enable this
C is out as CLONE just creates a virtual copy and not physical copies
D is out because multi-cluster warehouses are there for performance improvement and not back up
strategy
