6. A Data Engineer creates a stream object on a transaction source table to capture
new records in the source table and insert the records into a dimension table.
The source table gets updated daily. An INSERT statement is configured to run a
task on a schedule once a week, on Sunday at 8:05 PM Eastern Standard Time,
using CRON syntax: 5 20 * * 0
After 10 days of creating the stream and task objects, the Engineer realized that
the task never ran because the task was not resumed after creation.
If the data retention period for the source table is set to 1 day, how many days of
records since the creation of the source table will be read from the stream object
once the task is resumed? (NOTE: MAX_DATA_EXTENSION_TIME_IN_DAYS
parameter is set to 14 days.)
1. The last 1 day of records
2. The last 7 days of records
3. The last 10 days of records
4. The last 14 days of records
Answer : 4
