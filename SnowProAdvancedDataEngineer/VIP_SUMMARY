Question : 1
Execution Time (8m 20.81s) => Total time: 8 minutes 20.81 seconds — quite long for most queries.
Processing: 77% => 77% of the time is spent on processing, indicating computational bottlenecks.
Local Disk IO: 2%
Synchronization: 21%
Initialization: 1%
(100%)

Statistics

Scan progress: 100.00%
Bytes scanned: 5.61 GB
Percentage scanned from cache: 100.00% =>100% scanned from cache — good, but doesn’t help if query logic is inefficient.
Bytes written: 0.81 MB

Pruning
Partitions scanned: 1,328 => No pruning occurred, which is a red flag. This means every partition was scanned, increasing the workload.
Partitions total: 1,328

Spilling
Bytes spilled to local storage: 37.59 GB =>Indicates memory pressure; the data couldn't be processed in-memory, likely causing slowdowns.

Answer:  Increase the size of the virtual warehouse.

Question 2:
How can the following relational data be transformed into semi-structured data using the
LEAST amount of operational overhead?

| Row | PROVINCE | CREATED\_DATE |
| --- | -------- | ------------- |
| 2   | Alberta  | 2020-01-19    |
| 1   | Manitoba | 2020-01-18    |

Answer:  Use the OBJECT_CONSTRUCT function to return a Snowflake object.
SELECT OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('province', province, 'created_date', created_date) FROM provinces; // { "province": "Alberta", "created_date": "2020-01-19" }

B. The query must be executed using the same virtual warehouse.
C. The USED_CACHED_RESULT parameter must be included in the query.
D. The table structure contributing to the query result cannot have changed.
E. The new query must have the same syntax as the previously executed query.
F. The micro-partitions cannot have changed due to changes to other data in the
table.
Answer D, E, F
