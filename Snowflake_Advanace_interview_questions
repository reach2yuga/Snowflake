Data Engineer is performing below steps in sequence while working on Stream s1 created on table t1.
Step 1: Begin transaction.
Step 2: Query stream s1 on table t1.
Step 3: Update rows in table t1.
Step 4: Query stream s1.
Step 5: Commit transaction.
Step 6: Begin transaction.
Step 7: Query stream s1.
Mark the Incorrect Operational statements:

A) For Step 2, The stream returns the change data capture records between the current position to the Transaction 1 start time. If the
stream is used in a DML statement, the stream is then locked to avoid changes by concurrent transactions.
B) For Step 4, Returns the CDC data records by streams with updated rows happened in the Step 3 because Streams works in
Repeated committed mode in which statements see any changes made by previous statements executed within the same transaction,
even though those changes are not yet committed.
C) For Step 5, If the stream was consumed in DML statements within the transaction, the stream position advances to the transaction
start time.
D) For Step 7, Results do include table changes committed by Transaction 1.
E) if Transaction 2 had begun before Transaction 1 was committed, queries to the stream would have returned a snapshot of the stream
from the position of the stream to the be-ginning time of Transaction 2 and would not see any changes committed by Transac-tion 1.

Answer:B

Explanation:
Streams support repeatable read isolation. In repeatable read mode, multiple SQL statements within a transaction see the same set of
records in a stream. This differs from the read committed mode supported for tables, in which statements see any changes made by
previous statements executed within the same transaction, even though those changes are not yet committed.
The delta records returned by streams in a transaction is the range from the current position of the stream until the transaction start time.
The stream position advances to the transaction start time if the transaction commits; otherwise, it stays at the same position.
Within Transaction 1, all queries to stream s1 see the same set of records. DML changes to table t1 are recorded to the stream only
when the transaction is committed.
In Transaction 2, queries to the stream see the changes recorded to the table in Transaction 1. Note that if Transaction 2 had begun
before Transaction 1 was committed, queries to the stream would have returned a snapshot of the stream from the position of the
stream to the beginning time of Transaction 2 and would not see any changes committed by Transaction 1.
